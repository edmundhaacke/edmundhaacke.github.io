Major trauma is defined as one or more injuries, where disability or death is a likely result, leading to poor functional and health-related quality of life outcomes. The Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) is a widely used functional outcome measure in major trauma, and Health State Preference Weights (HSPWs) are desirable in order to inform future economic models. The GOS and GOSE following major trauma were mapped to the EuroQol EQ-5D-3L in line with the NICE referencr case. The adjust limited dependent variable mixture model was used to develop a model predicting EQ-5D-3L 12 months post-trauma as a function of GOS/GOSE and age. Excellent goodness of fit to the dataset used was observed.
